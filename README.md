# Regressions Models to Predict Bike Sharing
 Bike-sharing systems represent a transformative approach to urban mobility, offering a convenient and sustainable means of transportation. These systems operate through anetwork of automated kiosks strategically placed throughout cities, allowing users to rent bikes on a short-term basis for commuting, leisure, or exercise. The concept of bike-sharing originated in the 1960s in Europe, but it gained widespread adoption globally starting in the mid-2000s, particularly in densely populated urban areas where congestionand pollution are significant challenges.
